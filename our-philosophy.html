			<h2>Simple Low pH Skincare</h2>
			<p>The basics of good skin starts with moisture, sun protection, mild exfoliation and low pH. A short and concise ingredient list is all you really need to achieve this. Scientific studies have proven that the average person has a pH of 4.7 on the outer layer of their skin. This pH barrier can easily be disrupted by any products over the pH of 4.7, including water! If the pH is out of balance, it takes anywhere from 3-8 hours for the skin to return to its normal pH. Maintaining the skin at a slightly acidic pH of around 4.7 will help protect it from the elements and bacteria.  All of our products are created to have a pH of 4.7, with the exception of products intended for exfoliation, which will have an even lower pH. </p><br><br>
			
			<h2>Ingredient Transparency</h2>		
			<p>Most individuals are unaware of the ingredients which go into their skincare products. What is its purpose in the product, and is it truly safe for the skin? We strive to answer these questions and use only ingredients best for you. Each ingredient used in our products serves a purpose and we encourage all our customers to learn about each ingredient on our <a href="products.html">Products page</a> to understand what it’s made of. </p><br><br>

			<h2>Top Quality Ingredients</h2>
			<p>Our products only contain quality ingredients, carefully chosen to ensure they are beneficial for the skin and in well balanced quantities. We resolve not to use low cost filler ingredients in order to pack the most benefit in each drop of product.</p><br>
			<p>The definition of a natural product is loosely regulated, so the majority of products you see labeled “natural” still will contain synthetic ingredients. Just because a product is natural doesn’t mean it’s good for you! For example, chili pepper oil is natural, but it wouldn’t be recommended for skin application. “Naturally derived” is another term that frequently misleads consumers. Naturally derived ingredients are often altered so much that they bear little resemblance to their original natural state.</p><br>
			<p>We prefer to choose ingredients for our products based on its properties and benefits instead of whether it’s natural or synthetic. Most of our products are based primarily on natural plant oils due to their rich benefits. We choose ingredients which are non-comedogenic and are safe for sensitive skin.</p><br><br>

			<h2>Goodness</h2>
			<p>We believe good things are meant to be shared. By sharing products that we truly love and believe in with our consumers, we hope you can do the same by sharing your goodness with others. Beauty is not only external, it radiates from within. Smile more, love more, and give more.</p><br>
			<p>Jeni & Joy has made the commitment to donate a portion of the profits towards helping local communities. </p><br><br>
